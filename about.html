          <h2>About Me.</h2>
            <h3>My journey to UX.</h3>
              <p>In college is where I started my first business with the creation of a mobile application. This is what truly sparked my passion for product design. Flashback even further, and I can still hear my dad yelling for me not to scratch the floors while rearranging yet another room in the house. It was amazing the things 9-year-old Sylvia could move when I wanted to redesign a room to match my sketches for the new layout I had envisioned. And yes, the sketches included, maybe not so precise, measurements. I think I still have the blueprints for my vision of the kitchen remodel somewhere. Mom/Pop, let me know if you’re interested! The passion to design may have started with interior design, but didn’t stop there. I remember my poor mom had to deal with me in search of a prom dress that matched my designs in the old, black spiral sketchbook I took everywhere. Thinking back, I was designing logos for myself before I even had a signature.</p>
            <h3>The detour.</h3>
              <p> Prior to design, I worked in Wealth Management where I managed the book of business for a multimillion-dollar producing team of 4 financial advisors. In this role is where I learned the value of research and thoroughly enjoyed researching companies and the stock market for clients and my advisors. Working in such a fast-paced environment, addressing clients and my team daily, left me with a wide range of skill sets especially communication and customer service. In addition to that role, I was a complex coach, meaning a mentor to all Service Associates across the 4 state complex. Time management was essential as I was on call to the staff at all times in addition to my team and clients. That role also entailed the dissemination of firm rollouts, so I would host presentations for the complex to relay this information. Working in both roles strongly enhanced my project management skills. Working in finance, there would always be updates to the software we used for everyday tasks. After getting familiar with each new update or platform I would find myself wishing I could have been a part of the creation process. The new software always seemed like the user was never tested. I frequently found myself thinking about the software and what I would have done differently. Deep down I always knew I needed a job that would allow me to create. This led me to enroll in the Bloc/Thinkful Design Track Bootcamp where I have been eagerly learning as much as possible. While at my UI UX Design apprenticeship with Bloc/Thinkful I have created multiple customer-driven projects where I have worked as the UX researcher, UI designer, and developer reporting to a senior product designer. One thing that excites me most about UX Design is that there is always more to learn as the environment is constantly evolving.</p>
            <h3>A little more about me.</h3>
              <p>I’ve always been a problem solver and enjoyed implementing those skills through finance, or side projects like rebuilding old laptops just for the challenge. Now I’m excited to solve problems with design. In a further description of myself, I’m an animal, planet loving vegetarian. Growing up I would help my dad make wine and now for fun, I enjoy brewing beer with my partner. Living in Colorado has given me and my two dogs the opportunity to really appreciate the mountains and nature. I also enjoy looking at and photographing the street art Denver has to offer. Designs from other creators have inspired me to design and I hope to inspire others to create in return! My passion to create is deep-rooted and I’m determined to create designs and experiences that simplify and inspire!</p>
              <p>Did I mention I love coffee… oh, you too? Let’s connect over a cup!</p>
